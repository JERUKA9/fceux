{"name":"FCEUX","tagline":"","body":"FCEUX\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis is my personal branch of FCEUX, an NES/Famicom emulator. FCEUX is released\r\nunder the GPL license and is available from http://www.fceux.com/ and/or\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/fceultra/\r\n\r\nI have a few goals with this branch:\r\n\r\n1. Better code quality\r\n2. Emscripten support\r\n3. Additional scripting features\r\n4. Performance\r\n\r\nI’ve made several commits to improve code quality, remove warnings, etc. I’ve\r\nadded support for Lua 5.2. There’s still more to be done.\r\n\r\nEmscripten support was done by me a while ago as a WIP/hack. I’m now going back\r\nand doing it more properly/cleanly. This’ll allow you to run FCEUX in your\r\nbrowser at almost-native speeds.\r\n\r\nNotable Branches\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe branch clean-lua-5.2 contains my code quality fixes and support for Lua\r\n5.2.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
